# Pneumonia Detection using X-Ray scans

## Description:

The Pneumonia Detection project is an ML-based project that aims to detect pneumonia from X-ray scans. The project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify pneumonia in patients by analyzing chest X-ray scans. The project is built using the PyTorch framework, which provides state-of-the-art machine learning capabilities.

The dataset used in the project consists of X-ray images that have been labeled as either normal or pneumonia. The PyTorch deep learning model has been trained on this dataset using technique such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Technical Details:

* The project is built using the PyTorch framework and Python programming language.
* The dataset used in the project consists of X-ray scans that have been labeled as `normal` or `pneumonia`.
* The deep learning model has been trained using technique such as CNNs.
