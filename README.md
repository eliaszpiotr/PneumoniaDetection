# Detection of irregularities in the organs of the chest using X-ray images

## Description:

The Detection of Irregularities in Chest Organs project is an ML-based project that aims to detect various irregularities in the organs of the chest using X-ray images. The project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify abnormalities in the lungs, heart, and other chest organs by analyzing chest X-ray scans. The project is built using the PyTorch framework, which provides state-of-the-art machine learning capabilities.

Currently, the project focuses on detecting pneumonia from X-ray images. The dataset used in the project consists of X-ray images that have been labeled as either normal or abnormal. The PyTorch deep learning model has been trained on this dataset using techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Future plans for the project involve expanding its capabilities to include the detection of other chest-related conditions and abnormalities that can be identified using X-ray images.

## Technical Details:

* The project is built using the PyTorch framework and Python programming language.
* The dataset used in the project consists of X-ray scans that have been labeled as `normal` or `pneumonia`.
* The deep learning model has been trained using technique such as CNNs.

## Version:
### v2.0.0

- Upgraded classification model architecture for improved performance
- Added new features to enhance model efficiency
- Modified training loop for increased effectiveness

### v0.1.0-alpha
* This is the first alpha release of the Pneumonia Detection project.
* The machine learning model has been trained using PyTorch and convolutional neural networks.
* The model is capable of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray scans, but further testing and improvements are required.
* This release is intended for testing purposes only and should not be used in production environments.

***Please note**: This is an alpha release and the model is not yet fully optimized for production use. Further improvements will be made in the upcoming releases.*
