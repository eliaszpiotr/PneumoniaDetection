# Detection of irregularities using X-ray images

## Description:

The Pneumonia Detection project is an ML-based project that aims to detect pneumonia from X-ray scans. The project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify pneumonia in patients by analyzing chest X-ray scans. The project is built using the PyTorch framework, which provides state-of-the-art machine learning capabilities.

The dataset used in the project consists of X-ray images that have been labeled as either normal or pneumonia. The PyTorch deep learning model has been trained on this dataset using technique such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Technical Details:

* The project is built using the PyTorch framework and Python programming language.
* The dataset used in the project consists of X-ray scans that have been labeled as `normal` or `pneumonia`.
* The deep learning model has been trained using technique such as CNNs.

## Version:

### v0.1.0-alpha
* This is the first alpha release of the Pneumonia Detection project.
* The machine learning model has been trained using PyTorch and convolutional neural networks.
* The model is capable of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray scans, but further testing and improvements are required.
* This release is intended for testing purposes only and should not be used in production environments.

***Please note**: This is an alpha release and the model is not yet fully optimized for production use. Further improvements will be made in the upcoming releases.*
